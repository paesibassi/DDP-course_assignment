The\n# documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started\n# using your application. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server Share\n# the application link by pasting it into the text box below Share your server.R\n# and ui.R code on github\n# The application must include the following:\n# - Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)\n# - Some operation on the ui input in sever.R\n# - Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations\n# You must also include enough documentation so\n# that a novice user could use your application. The documentation should be at\n# the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link. The Shiny\n# application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having\n# trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction\n# algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets\n# packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't\n# need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You\n# should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(\"shinythemes\")\nrunApp(\"./shinyapp\", display.mode = \"showcase\")\n\n### Deployment ----\nlibrary(shinyapps)\nshinyapps::deployApp('./shinyapp')\n### ---\n\n### App data ----\nlibrary(pgmm); library(ggplot2)\ndata(olive)\nolive$Region <- as.factor(olive$Region)\nolive$Area <- as.factor(olive$Area)\n\nggplot(data = olive, aes(x = Area, y = Palmitic, color = Linoleic)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nggplot(data = olive, aes_string(x = input$variableX, y = input$variableY, color = \"Area\")) +\n  geom_point()\n\nkm <- kmeans(olive, centers = 3)\ntable(k$cluster)\nk$size\nolive$cluster <- km$cluster\n",
